NVIC( Nested Vector Interrupt Controller ) discussion 


-> NVIC is one of the peripheral of the Cortex M processor core 

-> it is used to configure 240 interrupts

-> using NVIC registers you can Enable/Disable/Pend various interrupts and read the status of active and pending interrupts.

-> you can configure the priority and priority grouping of various interrupts.

-> It is called Nested because it supports pre-empting a lower priority interrupt handler when higher priority interrupts arrives.





Enable/Disable/Pend various interrupt using NVIC register.


->Cortex M processor supports 240 interrupts

-> These interrupts are managed and configured using NVIC 

-> what are those 240 interrupts ?
     this is highly vendor specific and it is triggered by various on chip peripherals of the MCU like SPI, GPIOs ,CAN , Timers, DMAs, etc

-> STM32f407xx MCU delivers 83 different interrupts to the processor

-> TIVA MCU delivers 154 different interrupts to the processor out of 250 interrupts supported by the ARM Cortex M processor.
