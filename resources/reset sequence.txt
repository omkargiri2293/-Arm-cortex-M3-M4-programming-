Reset sequence of the Cortex M Processor 

-> when you reset the processor, the PC is loaded with the value 0x0000_0000

-> then processor reads the value @ memory location 0x0000_0000 in to MSP	MSP = value@0x0000_0000
	MSP is a Main Stack Pointer register
that means processor first initializes the Stack Pointer

-> After that, processor reads the value @ memory location 0x0000_0004 
in to PC .
that value is actually address of the reset handler.

-> PC jumps to reset handler.

-> A reset handler is just a C or Assembly function written by you to carry out any initializations required.

-> from reset handler you call your main() function of the application
