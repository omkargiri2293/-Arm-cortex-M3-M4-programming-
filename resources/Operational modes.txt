Operational mode of the processor

M0/M3/M4

processor gives two operational modes 
1. Thread mode
2. Handler mode

-> all your application code will execute under "thread mode" of processor.
This is also called "User mode"

-> All the exception handlers or interrupt handlers will run under the "Handler mode" of the processor.

-> processor always start with "Thread mode"

-> whenever the core meets with the system exception or any external interrupts then the core will change its mode to handler mode in order to 
service the ISR associated with that system exception or the interrupt. ok?
