Cortex M processor Exception model

M0/M1/M3/M4/M7

1. What is exception ?
-> Anything which disturbs normal operation of the program by changing the operational mode of the processor.

-> There are 2 types of exceptions
1) system exceptions
2) interrupts

-> system exceptions are generated by the processor itself internally.

-> interrupts come from the external world to the processor.

-> whenever the processor core meets with an exception it changes the operational mode to "Handler mode".

-> There are in total 15 system exceptions supported by the Cortex M processors and 240 interrupts.
So, in total Cortex M processors support 255 exceptions.
